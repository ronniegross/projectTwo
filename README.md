# Gnarnia

## Goal
To create an application that will allow users to reserve snowboarding gear, ski gear, and a lift ticket in order to achieve radical gnar

## Project Description
Create an app that:
* Have at least 3 models
* Have full CRUD on at least one of your models
* Be able to Add/Delete on any remaining models
* Use the Mongoose library to write Mongo queries
* Have high quality code
* Efficient code- if you have your MVP, refactor
* DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) code
* Be deployed on Heroku

## List of Technologies Used
* Node
* Express
* MongoDB
* Handlebars
* Heroku
* Sketch

## Reflections
* Create basic functionality of absolute MVP prior to any styling
* MVP comes before UX 
* Simplify and be very specific with naming conventions
* Meditation + yoga were a necessity this week

## Version Two
* Independant gear order routes: snowboard + lift ticket vs ski + lift ticket
* Add functionality to select rental + lift ticket date
* Add functionality to allow user to view order history
* Functionality that allows user to log into previously created account
* Add waiver to sign up page
* Add functionality that allows user to only create an account if they are 18+
* Buttons to select items rather than having the user type in their order
* Add mountain background to body
* Refactor code, especially CSS and focus on responsive design on desktop and mobile
